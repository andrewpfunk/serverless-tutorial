# serverless-tutorial

Learn how to develop a full-stack web app using only a web browser, and host it in the cloud for free

This tutorial will show you how to:
- Create a client-side web app using HTML and JavaScript, hosted on GitHub.com
- Add serverless functions for database connectivity and deploy your app to Netlify.com
- Store your web app data in the cloud with Couchbase.com

## Prologue

Create a client-side web app and host it on GitHub.com

Reference: https://pages.github.com/

- If necessary, create an account on GitHub.com
- Create a new public repository named *username*.github.io
- In your new repository, click Add file
- Name the file index.html and paste the following content
~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
</body>
</html>
~~~
- Click Commit changes
- Open a new browser tab and go to: https://*username*.github.io

At this point you may choose to experiment with adding and updating pages in your repo on GitHub.com. As you commit changes they should automatically be deployed to your live web site.

### Local development

One of the goals of this tutorial is to show how you can do everything in a web browser. But you will eventually want to do local development on your computer. Here are the basic steps.
